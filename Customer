1.	User downloads the app from play_store/apple_store
2.  Application asks to enter the phone number. Payse server generates an OTP and sends it the customer via SMS using an introductory message about Payse. 
    Customer enters the OTP, which gets authenticated against the Payse server. 
3.	Application sends the OTP to this no. and auto reads it to verify the phone no.
   [After doing some research- Auto verification of OTP might not be a good idea, since it can be vulnerable for potential hacks. Manual verification, as done in other apps. 
    You can use SMPP protocol to push messages to the intended recipient. There are few open source implementation which provide smpp protocol implementation out of the box. ]
4.	Next, user sign in with google. 
   [- This links user's name + email id + whole bunch of friend's email ids]
